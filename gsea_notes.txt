Trying out GSEA on RNAseq expression dataset
This is very preliminary - and may not be right!

Expression file: rnaseq_cufflinks_fpkm_gsea_expr.txt
Phenotype labels file: rnaseq_cufflinks_fpkm_gsea_phenotype_labels.cls

Phenotype labels: 
- <a patient> vs REST (autogenerated?)
- <a patient> vs MEAN (1st patient col from dataset)

Settings:
Gene sets database: h.all.v6.0.symbols.gmt [Hallmarks] (good starting point)
Number of permutations: 1000
Collapse dataset to gene symbols: false (they're already gene symbols)
Permutation type: gene_set (don't have multiple samples/class)
Chip platform: GENE_SYMBOL.chip (generic gene symbols since we don't actually have a chip)

Other basic and advanced fields set to defaults
